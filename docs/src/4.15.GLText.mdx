# Text

`<GLText />` renders text in the 3D scene (unlike `<Text />`, which renders additional DOM nodes).

The prop types are identical to `<Text />`, except that additionally each Text object supports an optional `billboard?: boolean` property. If true (the default), text will always face the camera; if false, text may be rotated in 3D according to `pose.orientation`.

<GLText />

## Scale Invariance

`<GLText />` also supports rendering text at a constant scale regardless of the zoom level by using the optional `scaleInvariantFontSize?: number` property. If set (default is `undefined`), the text will be rendered always at the same size, resembling the behavior of the `<Text />` command. 

Please note that `scaleInvariantFontSize` only works if the `billboard` property is set to true.

<GLTextScaleInvariant />

## Resolution

By default, `<GLText />` uses a high resolution font texture atlas for rendering text, which may have an impact on the performance of your application. 

The `resolution?: number` optional property allows to override this behavior by providing a custom character resolution value. If your application does not need to render text that is too close the camera, it is recommended to reduce the font resolution to ensure a better performance.

Default value is `resolution={160}`. Minimum value is `resolution={40}`. 

## Alphabet

`<GLText />` generates a new texture atlas on the fly whenever a merker's text contains at least one character that was not rendered before. This is a complex operation and may impact on the performance of your application. 

For that reason, is recommended to use the optional `alphabet?: string[]` property to provide a list of characters that are allowed as part of any marker's text. 

For example, if markers are known to have only digits, you can use the `alphabet` property as follows to reduce the number of times the texture atlas need to be re-generated from (potentially) 10 times to only once.

`<GLText alphabet{['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', '0']}>{markers}</GLText>`
